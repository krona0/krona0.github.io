Hey, my new friends. I'm bs0bj(aka.CanYellPea), currently a developer dedicated to achieving FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, and also an anonymous political activist on the internet.

In my view, the world doesn't just have one choice. Diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder in middle school, I felt the despair of being shackled by societal expectations. I spent a long time reading on the balcony and completed high school at home. However, when I entered university, I found that academic spirit was lacking. Educational institutions instilled the importance of diplomas to naive students, all to market their one-stop training courses. Bureaucracy colluded with power, outsourcing software development for students' daily activities such as eating, bathing, and registering for classes. (Ten years ago, students didn't need to download nine different software just to attend classes.)

Public education? Aren't universities and other academic institutions supposed to be places where destinies are changed? Aren't they supposed to provide good opportunities for self-education? Far from it. Schools are more like barracks than any other institution. People's thoughts are trained and manipulated here to comply with various social and mental illusions, allowing those who leave campus to continue perpetuating this system of exploitation and oppression.

Consciously leaving behind the seemingly easy arranged life, I delved deep into the blockchain, cryptocurrency, and ETF markets. Through precise analysis and investment strategies, I achieved the goal of supporting myself with passive income. This process not only brought me financial freedom but also benefited me the most by reading different books. Self-education (active learning) kept my personal thoughts sharp and helped me deeply understand the operating rules of the financial market. In this field, I continue to learn, explore, and attempt to combine automation technology with investment, always striving to find more opportunities and possibilities for decentralized overseas investment.

Being a market analysis trader is a field I've delved into deeply, while serving as a member of a cyber guerrilla team is my main occupation. I lurk in different countries, maintaining proxy servers for 7 platforms for the open-source community. In terms of DeepWeb political propaganda, I have created a series of works such as "Political Enemy is 'Agreement'", "The End of Sadness is Love", "Work Talk", "Would You Like to Think with Me?", "Absurd World", etc., dedicated to conveying information and viewpoints through technical means.

Even if the end of the world comes, I still love life. I believe love is subversive; it threatens the established order of our modern life. The mundane rituals of productivity on weekdays and socialized ceremonies will no longer have any meaning for someone in love, because there is a greater force guiding them than mere inertia and obedience to tradition. Marketing strategies that rely on indifference or insecurity to sell products that maintain economic operations have no effect on them. Entertainment designed for passive consumption depends on the fatigue or cynicism of the audience, and they will no longer be interested in it.

My good friend HUSTAR and I are DJs who frequent the EXPLORE NIGHT events, and we also appear physically on the streets of major cities, abs & system, bringing sensory experiences to people. What truly matters is not wearing authoritative symbolic clothing but that both you and I have a fragile and sensitive heart.

During my tenure in the cyber guerrilla team, I joined the CTF Red Team to debug and develop the Medusa platform. I enjoy writing Python scripts in my spare time to optimize surfing experiences and streamline operating systems. I strive to hone myself in the field of computer science, enthusiastic about advocating for information technology open source and free education resource sharing, breaking through information cocoons.

I question traditional education. I believe that if people want to learn, they just need to bring their brains. Actively reading, communicating, and practicing can allow mastery of most fields of study. The blockade of information and the media being controlled by authoritative agencies lead to knowledge being monopolized by educational institutions. I will devote my life to free education resources and open-source technology.
